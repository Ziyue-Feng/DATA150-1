# Human Development & Data Science Knowledge Creation by Kaori Southall 




The advent of data science and advancement in information technology has been praised for developing a stream of new and digitized data relating to how individuals, businesses, societies, and organizations related. While raw data is not meaningful, processed data can be converted into knowledge about social and economic agents' underlying behavior. This exercise often requires organizations and researchers to deal with the substantial amount of unstruc-tured and heterogeneous data, an endeavour requires careful planning and organization of the data by considering the particularities of the social and economic analyses. The outcomes of the data analysis are critical as it helps predict events and ultimately help state agents make crucial national decisions.
   
   
The healthcare sector has significantly gained from our ability to describe, analyze, and predict the human development process. Through big data analytics, societies and organizations have been able to analyze the existing information and predict a pattern of social development. Within the healthcare setting, this practice has been critical, particularly in patient care process and disease exploration (Belle et al., 2015). Furthermore, I'm hopeful that data science is going to be key in measuring the economic trajectory of a nation. West (2017) avers that data occurs a basis for the construction, testing, and refining of our theories and models and whether they seek to explain nature's evolutionary processes; these assertions confirm Kitchin's postulation (2014) that there is a paradigm shift from theory to data. For instance, traditionally, the researchers relied on theories like Malthusian and Kremer population theory to determine the economic development trajectory of nations (Azam, Khan, & Khan, 2020). However, with the advent of data science, the relationship can be determined by describing and analyzing the data to determine the relationship between the two variables.
  
  
However, data science could have devasting effects on individuals when left unchecked. For instance, in the 2016 United States general election, personal information of electorates from social media platforms like Facebook were used to manipulate the electorates poll decision through misinformation and fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). Considering the significance of elections and political freedom, as argued by Sen (2001), the electorates' manipulation was a significant injustice to the nation's democracy. Moreover, data science can target and discriminate against individuals, which is a significant concern in modern society. Besides, while data science has great potential in contemporary society, it is faced with major obstacles that can curtail its efforts to improve society's status. Some of these obstacles include confidentiality, privacy, and security of the data (Abouelmehdi, Beni-Hssane, Khaloufi, & Saadi, 2017). This problem calls for the need for effective policies that protect the information while at the same time, ensuring that individuals give consent to use their private information.
  
  
 Even so, the advent of data science shall go a long way in improving humanity's living standards through research and development, inventions, and innovations and predictions of future events, hence enabling the society to avert certain uncomfortable situations and conditions. For instance, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, data science has been critical in the projection of infection trends, the disease's economic impact, helping countries, and businesses reorganize themselves effectively.
