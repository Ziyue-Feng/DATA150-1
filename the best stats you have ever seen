Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen

It’s evident from the ted talk that there are huge misconceptions that exist in perceiving developing worlds. The world is still segregated between two categories, that is the western world and the third world. Divisions are mostly attributed to the level of household income, GDP per capita, life expectancy, and infant mortality rate. However, parts of the current attributes are misrepresentation of the numerous developments that have taken place in the “developing” or third world countries. To bridge the existing data discrepancies, governments, private organizations, and non-governmental organizations must all integrate their data to come up with a single database to minimize information discrepancy and to have a targeted approach towards global development.

There are existing misconceptions about the developing world, which are outdated. Misconceptions such as developing worlds having families that are large but possessing a shorter life span are outmoded (Ted, 2006). Countries like Bangladesh and India that were considered developing countries share the same life expectancy and fertility rate with developed countries such as the United States and Germany. Furthermore, the GDP per capita of several countries in South Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa have improved, which has lifted many nations form these regions out of poverty. However, information from these areas tends to be aggregated, which overshadows some countries that have made substantial development strides. According to Ted (2006), Africa has a combined GDP per Capita of $2,500; however, when you look at individual countries from the continent, it reveals a different picture. An example is how Sierra Leone has a GDP per capita of $500, while Mauritius her a GDP per capita of $40,000, almost similar to OECD countries. The use of aggregate data has helped to fuel the misconception among developed countries, which hampers targeted solutions in terms of aid (UN, 2019). Without proper access and data integration, people tend to underestimate the social changes that have taken place in several developing countries, which have also led to positive economic impacts. 

To eliminate the existing misconceptions and bridge the gap on information discrepancies, supranational institutions, governments, private institutions, and non- governmental institutions should all come together to link existing databases with different output designs to promote access to information. Data sharing among various institutions can only be achieved by making the linked data searchable. Greater access to data and the use of new design tools to visualize the data can stem out some misconceptions surrounding the developing countries.
