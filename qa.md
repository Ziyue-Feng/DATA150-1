Hans Rosling:

•	In Hans Rosling’s “Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen”, he talks about preconceived ideas about global development and global health. What is comparison? What is difference between western world and 3rd world? Describe how rosling introduced preconceived ideas and description of difference.

There is still a distinction between the western world and the third world. However, there have been numerous global health developments that have seen most countries that were considered as “third world”, gaining the status of an industrialized nation. From the Ted Talk by Hans Rosling, countries such as China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India that were considered as developing countries have improved their life expectancy during the onset of the 21 century (Ted, 2006). An indication that some developing countries have caught up to those countries that were already industrialized. Income distribution has also improved around the world, which has led to the narrowing of gap between rich and poor countries. Today, countries such as Mauritius that were “third world” have the same GDP per capita with countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Singapore.
Although there are several notable global health improvements in countries that were developing, there are still existing differences. One difference is the child survival rate. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries have a high child survival rate of almost 99%. In contrast, African countries and countries from South Asia possess low child survival rates of 90% and below (Ted, 2006). Furthermore, countries in Africa still possess low life expectancies at birth compared to countries from the OECD, such as Germany that have high life expectancies.
Rosling mainly introduced the preconceived ideas by describing a pre-test that he had offered to a few Swedish students. However, from the test results, Hans Rosling discovered that most students answered the questions applying a set preconceived idea rather than facts. The same concept can be applied to the global stage where lack of shared data limits individuals' and institutions' decisions based on preconceived ideas. To eliminate the existing misconceptions and bridge the existing information gap. Supranational institutions, governments, private institutions, and non- governmental institutions should all come together to link existing databases with different output designs to promote access to information.

•	Which comes first, wealth or health? What was his point and what was the example he gave? Describe health care and education, why are these endeavors important? Are they important because they are high cost or is there another reason, they are important?

In this book, Amartya Sen starts by focusing on the importance of having wealth. In his comments, he insists that wealth only becomes useful because of the freedom it affords the people. Wealth is the determinant for almost everything in life – the kind of life people live. The existence of wealth dictates the good health that people enjoy. Sen continues to say that freedom determines the social, economic, and political effectiveness of a person. Better healthcare and education can only be achieved when wealth is available.

Amartya Sen:

•	What is development? Is it more expansive or a narrower view than we normally hold? Why?
Development is the process of expanding the freedom that people enjoy. Development thus requires the removal of any source of unfreedom in the day-to-day lives of the people. Freedom is pivotal to the development process because of the evaluative and effectiveness reasons.

•	What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires to be removed? Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?
Development is the process of expanding the freedom that people enjoy. Development thus requires the removal of any source of unfreedom in the day-to-day lives of the people. Freedom is pivotal to the development process because of the evaluative and effectiveness reasons.
 
•	Who were Condorcet and Malthus? And what did they argue? Who is right?

Thomas Malthus, an English economist and demographer, believed that the world population will always supersede the food supply. According to him, unless a strong regulation is placed to control reproduction, people will always remain poor. This theory is an exact contradiction of Condorcet's idea. Condorcet was a French mathematician who believed that overpopulation could be solved by controlling human actions like increasing productivity, better environmental conservation, and better education. Condorcet believed that such empowerment could significantly contribute to controlling the reproduction rate. Condorcet advocates for freedom, while Malthus goes for restrictions. A free mind has the most power to effect change, making Condorcet's approach better in solving the problem of overpopulation and development.
