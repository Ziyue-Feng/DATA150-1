ACE Study and Future Future Disease Control 


# Introduction


Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) pose as a major challenge in many public health sectors. Exposing children to abuse, neglect and family dysfunctions not only does it affect the healthy emotional, physical and behavioral development but also contributes to morbidity in adulthood. The Biological Embedding of Childhood Adversity Model (BECAM) provides a clear explanation for this phenomenon. BECAM posits that childhood stress that arise from poverty or maltreatment causes cytokine response to challenge as well as reduce sensitivity in hormonal signals hence leading to problematic behaviors like living unhealthy lifestyles. These factors, when joined with other traumatic exposures are deemed to provoke chronic diseases in adulthood. Childhood adversity has been linked to health-related complications like obesity, liver diseases, cancer, and heart diseases (Burke et al., 2011). The central research question is to identify the correlation between child traumatic events and chronic conditions later in life. 

# Type of inquiry


For the investigation relationship between adverse childhood and future chronic conditions would be done effectively through descriptive inquiry. Descriptive inquiry involves assessment of the profile of the situation and describe how it works and why is it does that way. The inquiry assesses the relationship of the occurrence of the chronic conditions among those suffering from adverse childhood experiences. The inquiry suits the central research question. Since it provides with the assessment of the situation and how it occurs, the descriptive inquiry helps in providing information necessary to understand the relation. Through such inquiry, a lot of gaps can be identified in the research, thus assisting in assessing the nature of the relation between adverse childhood experiences and the chronic conditions. Through the inquiry, the impact of the adverse childhood experiences in children can be assessed. The three subheadings include:

ii.	What Can We Do to Prevent Childhood Trauma as a Public Health Issue?

iii.	Which Areas in the United States have ACE Cases?


# Geospatial Data Science Methods


Geospatial data science methods are essential and relevant in application of the correlation between adverse childhood experiences and chronic conditions in future life. Among the employed geospatial data science methods include a bottom-up approach and mathematical theory. A bottom-up approach refers to joining of systems to give rise to more complicated systems thus makes the initial subsystems of the emergent system. In this research, childhood trauma does not start with the child; it starts with the parents as well as grandparents of that child. This is where the bottom-up approach comes in place, starting off by helping the parents and grandparents to deal with their trauma to prevent the cycle from repeating itself. This is one of the geo special methods used in preventing adverse childhood experiences from occurring.
According to the mathematical theory, the process involves incorporation of the algorithm that helps in finding the relationship between the occurrences. The algorithm helps in the identifying the problem thus indicating the areas to assist in initiating preventive measures. In relation to effects of adverse childhood experience, the method allows determination of the various interplay of different parties involves in adverse childhood experiences such as parents and legal system. As well, the method is crucial in identifying the areas to target in prevention of the adverse childhood experience.


- Question 1: What is the Impact of ACEs on Urban Pediatric Population?


Adverse Childhood Experiences like abuse, community and family violence, and neglect pose as significant health challenge in the United States. It is evident that 30-40% of youths who are exposed to family violence have a tendency of developing posttraumatic experiences like nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and physiological hyper-arousal like insomnia. These symptoms affect behavioral, emotional and academic development of a child. The physiological impacts associated with ACEs not only does it affect the mental health of the child but has been seen to correlate with other medical conditions (Burke et al., 2011).

To study the impact of traumatic experiences on the development of a child, a study between the prevalence of ACE categories in various urban populations was carried out. The study also involved learning both psychological and physiological factors associated with those children. In addition, physical development like obesity is also among the outcomes that were chosen since they are risk factors for chronic diseases. To be specific, learning and behavior challenges have been clearly associated with depression, bullying, anxiety and suicidal cases among other cases. In this study, nine categories were used: physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, alcohol and drug abuser in the family, incarcerated members of the household, chronically depressed member of the household or someone who is mentally ill in the household, mother being treated harshly, one or no parents in the household and finally emotional or physical neglect of the child (Burke et al., 2011). The chart below (Figure 1) was included to document the ACE categories of every participant.

Figure 1 


According to Burke, physical and emotional abuse is the major issues facing young children in the United States. This has been caused by violent fathers when drunk or their guardians (Burke et al., 2011). This has negatively affected the growth of the child physically, emotionally and academically.


- Question 2:  What Can We Do to Prevent Childhood Trauma as a Public Health Issue?


Childhood trauma is the main cause of serious health repercussions in adult life and has been declared a public health issue that requires prevention efforts. According to the research, experiencing traumatic events in young ages puts a child at a risk of many lifelong health problems (Lambert et al., 2017). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, many Americans known to have experienced adverse childhood experiences, they were at a higher risk of dying from the main leading causes of death worldwide (Lambert et al., 2017). Other children who had been exposed to worse experiences like sexual abuse, neglect and witnessing family violence in their homesteads were at the highest risk of dying from those top 10 killer diseases. A recent research conducted by the CDC has proved that 1 out of 6 people in the United States have in one way or another experienced five or more kinds of adverse childhood experiences. 

That is why it is of utmost importance to come up with ways of preventing these adverse childhood experiences and lower their impact on children as stated by the CDC principal deputy, Dr. Anne. She also stated that preventing ACEs can greatly help children and adults to live a normal life and significantly reduce the risk of health complications like cancer, diabetes and asthma. The new report released by CDC estimate how many Americans have been affected by ACEs and the potential benefits associated with preventing these traumatic experiences. According to Dr. Anne Schuchat, there are various ways in which childhood trauma experiences can be prevented and mitigate its effects in case it occurs. Some of the ways include mentoring programs which connect children in school in the hands of caring adults. Another approach is strengthening the economic support of low-income families. In addition, one can volunteer to help parents and youth on how to handle stress instead of fighting. The government should come up with improved access to primary caring, identifying and addressing childhood trauma whenever it happens.

Dr. Anne states that it is the primary role of physicians to mitigate the effects of childhood trauma. For instance, pediatricians can take part in screening parents and children for childhood trauma in an attempt to address the potential health problems associated with trauma (Lambert et al., 2017). There exist various programs that can be incorporated in primary care offices by pediatricians as stated by CDC director James Mercy. Some of these programs are Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) which has shown to be very effective especially when giving clinicians tools to lower child maltreatment. Dr. Anne Schuchat concluded by stating that everyone has got a role to play when it comes to prevention of ACEs, is it parents, schools, neighbors, families or the government in general. 


- Question 3: Which Areas in the United States have ACE Cases?


With the accumulation of ACEs being strongly predictive, most policymakers want to understand the various challenges which are facing children in their states. This will greatly help in targeting limited resources necessary for relevant interventions. It is well known that efforts put forth to reduce the likelihood of any ACE occurring are much likely to make a difference in the general well-being. In most areas of the United States like West Virginia, 71 out of 3 children are believed to have experienced economic hardship compared to five children in the areas of Minnesota, North Dakota and New Hampshire. In other areas like Kentucky and Arkansas, almost one-third of children have been forced to deal with divorce or parent separation. About 18% of the children living in Illinois, Massachusetts, Utah and Maryland have had to deal with divorce as well.
Other adverse childhood experiences like death of a parent and being a victim of violent families are a bit rare. Nationally, these occurrences were identified in only 3% of the children. However, these experiences are more prevalent in other states like Arkansas and Georgia. In the surveyed children, about 6% have experienced the death of a parent or a guardian in Arkansas and Georgia. The spreadsheet below shows prevalence of individual ACEs both nationally and by state. The yellow shading shows that the percentage is higher from the national average in terms of statistics. The blue shading shows that the percentage is lower compared to the national average statistically. Red shading shows that the estimate ought to be interpreted with caution since relative confidence is greater than 120%.

Figure 2


The information from the above table (Figure 2) is gathered from various states where adverse childhood experiences are mostly reported. It is evident that most children in the United States are victims of parent divorce (Lambert et al., 2017). Another significant number of children presented in the chart are those that have witnessed violence in their household. The two issues are most prevalent and major cause of adverse childhood experiences in many areas of the United States.




# Areas of future research


The research provides with the understanding of adverse childhood experiences including some of the proposed ways of preventing these impacts in later life. Future researches should be concerning appropriate ways of helping those already affected with adverse childhood experiences. The preventive approach though helps in reducing effects of adverse childhood experiences, those who are affected also need to be helped. When appropriate ways to help those already affected are in place, the chances of developing these complications could be minimized. Therefore, further research should assess how to help those already affected.
