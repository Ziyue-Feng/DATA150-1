The emergence of mobile phone technologies drives communication and has also proven useful in disaster management. The impact of mobile technology has been felt during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the technology was used to trace the people who are believed to have been exposed to the disease. Besides, technology has been critical in the crisis period. It allowed individuals who show symptoms of the coronavirus diseases to contact healthcare practitioners who offered guidance on the management and care of individuals with the disease. In this respect, mobile phone technology in disaster aid and planning is critical, primarily through the analysis of the Mobile Network Operators (MNO) data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data that can rely on live mobility patterns of the users of the phone booth at the locally and across the country, enabling health practitioners to contact trace while at the same time offer medical advice.

According to Sen (2001), development requires the removal of unfreedom in the daily lives of the people. Such unfreedom includes the lack of proper healthcare facilities. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare as human freedom has been put to the test and the modern healthcare facilities stretched to their limits. While such pandemics are unforeseen, the healthcare facilities and structures must remain robust to provide the citizens with the freedoms associated with healthcare services. Thus, it is important to review various articles that address the use of mobile devices in disaster aid.


Mobile Technology and Disaster Management

BBC. (2011, September 2). Mobile phones help to target disaster aid, says study. Retrieved from BBC News: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-14761144

The news article BBC addresses the utilization of mobile phones to target disaster aid. The article reveals that scientists used mobile data to target the movement of 2 million people in Haiti following an earthquake based on the data derived from various handsets. The information allowed the aid workers to channel relief help and assistance to the affected population, particularly those in the area of need. According to the report, immediately after the earthquake in Haiti, people fled from the city Port au Prince. This made it challenging to target the individuals who have been affected by the earthquake. However, through the utilization of mobile network organizations data scientists and relief aid providers were able to contact trace all the parties affected by the earthquake and provided them with the much-needed care. 

In the news article, the researchers focused on the management and mitigation of unfreedoms associated with natural disasters that often impact the livelihoods and both physical and mental health of the victims of the earthquake. Haiti managed to ensure the safety of the citizens through the use of innovative technologies to help in targeting those who need relief aid it could be medical aid or resources for sustenance like food, shelter and clothes that could have been destroyed by the earthquake. Through using the technology to limit the unfreedoms associated with the earthquake and improving the situation of the citizens by promoting safety and their well-being. 


Mobile Data and Emergency Response in Haiti

Gething, P. W., & Tatem, A. J. (2011). Can mobile phone data improve emergency response to natural disasters?. PLoS Med, 8(8), e1001085.

In the article, Can mobile phone data improve emergency response to natural disasters? Gething and Tatem (2011) report disaster management requires accurate data and must link the data collection and analysis to an immediate decision-making process. The authors acknowledge that the current approaches to evaluating the population movement immediately after a disaster are inadequate through critical among the individuals living in the remote areas of the disaster sites. The scholars further add that the proxy analysis, such as satellite reconnaissance, has potentially been impactful in the process; however, it has only provided a coarse topographical image of moving populations. There is the risk that such reports sometimes constitute a biased representation of events. The study further reflects another research conducted by Bengtsson, Lu, Thorson, Garfield, and Von Schreeb (2011).   

According to Bengtsson, Lu, Thorson, Garfield, and Von Schreeb (2011), Population movement following a disaster can increase morbidity and mortality, mainly when the movements are around individuals who do not know the infection. This phenomenon often compromises relief efforts. Furthermore, the movement and the difficulty to contact trace the individuals make it challenging to track individuals after a disaster accurately. The scholar proposes using position information of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile service providers in Haiti Digicel to determine the magnitude and trend of population movement following Haiti's 2010 cholera and earthquake.

The study's findings confirmed that routine collection of information on the movement of all active SIM cards in the disaster-affected nation could, with potentially high validity, be used to provide estimates of the magnitude, distribution, and trends in the population displacement. Through comparing census information before the disaster, the approach could be used to estimate area-specific population sizes that could result in an essential improvement in the allocation of relief supplies and the quality of needs assessment surveys. The study also indicates that the method was appropriate for close to living monitoring of population movement during an infectious disease outbreak.

The study's findings are critical, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that is often spread through making contact. The approach can monitor the movement of individuals who have been potentially exposed to the virus and other infectious diseases allowing for an appropriate and timely intervention from the healthcare practitioners and caregivers. Further, the movement data can also determine the contacts the target has made with other people, thus enhancing the government's efforts to contain infectious diseases. 


Mobile technology and disease Epidemiology

Salathe, M., Bengtsson, L., Bodnar, T. J., Brewer, D. D., Brownstein, J. S., Buckee, C., ... & Vespignani, A. (2012). Digital epidemiology. PLoS Comput Biol, 8(7), e1002616.

The article discusses the concept of Digital epidemiology by focusing on mobile, social, and real-time communication. According to the researchers, when harnessed and analyzed correctly, the digital data sources can provide local and timely information about a disease and the population's health dynamics globally. The authors also touch on the emergence of big data and its relevance in the epidemiology of infections. Additionally, the scholars suggest that the development and utilization of mobile technology information have helped improved disease surveillance compared to the traditional approaches that depended on theories and field practices that were inadequate, particularly during stressful conditions. The authors add that the population's movement can be tracked using mobile data and technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).

Besides, the article propounds that the use of call information, messages, and other mobile technologies enable individuals to be easily tracked as the analysis of this kind of information can pinpoint the locations of the individuals and also determine the pattern of movement among the citizens of interest allowing for an easy and timely determination of the whereabouts of the individuals and the people they made contact with throughout their interactions. Nevertheless, this practice is riddled with numerous shortcomings. First, such practices raise the question of privacy and confidentiality. While citizens are aware that the telephone service providers could collect certain personal information, the use and dissemination of such data have often been contentious. It often touches on critical personal data and sometimes an infringement of one's privacy.

The other issues are technical concerns, particularly regarding the collection, evaluation, and distribution of the information collected from individuals' phones and other digital devices.  The compilation, storage, and analysis of the massive data sets require sophisticated algorithms and software to be expensive to acquire and manage. The infrastructural requirement for collecting Realtime time data must include high bandwidth, low latency computer networks, access to vast amounts of storage, and additional machines for computation. These technical requirements and the large volumes of information make such systems impervious to hardware, network, and software failure. A further challenge is designing the algorithms and data structures that are efficient and scalable for the mining, processing, and analyzing large-scale epidemiological data. Besides, making sense of such information. Besides, making sense of data and minimizing errors require cutting-edge technology and cutting-edge medical analytical skills.  These challenges make it difficult for the effective and timely implementation of such models and systems during disasters and pandemics.  

Nonetheless, such a surveillance system would have been critical with the current COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare institutions could easily contact trace and use mobile information to determine how many people have been in contact with victims making it easy to contain the rates of infection and reduce mortalities.


Mobile data and Humanitarian Aid Japan

Lu, X., & Brelsford, C. (2014). Network structure and community evolution on Twitter: human behavior change in response to the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. Scientific reports, 4, 6773.

The article sets out to investigate the dynamics of social networks and the formation and evolution of the online communities in response to extreme events. The researcher collected three distinct datasets from Twitter, immediately before and after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan. The investigation revealed that while the entire population was affected and the online activities increased. The Japanese speakers who were presumed to be at the centre of the disaster expanded their network to a higher degree than English speakers or the global average. This confirms the systematic framework for investigating human behaviours under extreme events with online social network data, providing essential insights for understanding social interaction patterns during an extreme event.
 
The researchers aver that the study's data shines a light into individuals' behaviour during stressful conditions. The researchers report that an in-depth analysis of the social media data can help track the patterns of behaviour of the victims of natural disasters and hazards. Using the data, the aid workers can quickly determine the individuals affected by the hazard and its extent. Besides, considering the big user data generated by social sites. The interactions within the communities in the social sites can help in the ain initiatives to target specific individuals and help contain the impacts and the effects of the Tsunami on the general population.
 
 
 Mobile phone data for disease disaster management Africa 
 
 Cinnamon, J., Jones, S. K., & Adger, W. N. (2016). Evidence and future potential of mobile phone data for disease disaster management. Geoforum, 75, 253-264.
 
 The authors address the current global health threats such as Ebola and the Zika virus outbreaks that often require timely and rapid prevention efforts to reduce and recover from the disease dispersion. Further, the article adds to the broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourse on the utilization of mobile phone communication to enhancing the data environment in the circumstance of outbreaks. Cinnamon, Jones, and  Adger (2016) further bring over the view and examines the extant evidence and the future potential of mobile phone data extracted from Call Details Records and To-way Short Messaging Service (SMS) platforms for managing and responding to the natural hazards and other humanitarian crisis caused by outbreaks of infectious disease outbreaks. 
 
 Through the review of various relevant literature and conducting in-depth interviews with the Key informants to confirm the assumptions that the data that has been collected and mined from CDRs and SMS can be utilized in the management of the pandemics. The authors also report that mobile phone data contain essential information that can steer disaster management as they provide quality and a substantial amount of information relating to diseases and disasters. However, in many nations, the rolling out of such surveillance programs have been curtailed by various ethical concerns. The primary concern in such scenarios has often been individuals' data privacy. The article posits that data privacy has been studied significantly and was also a concern raised by the interview participants. The confidentiality issue was mainly directed to utilizing CDR data, considering it is full of personalized data about locations, Spatio-temporal movement, and an individual's communication patterns. Besides, the author acknowledges that it is possible to identify sensitive personal information from the data sets. The SMS information also raises serious privacy and confidentiality concerns as they are often designed to collect significantly sensitive data. Moreover, for the SMS systems designed to collect data from people on resources required or disease, an individual's locational privacy can be compromised. Besides, the compromise can also be seen in systems designed to collect signs and symptom information from the public contributions that often require that the ethical principle of confidentiality be broken. 
 
 Nevertheless, the article's assertions confirm that the mining of data from a mobile phone could bolster the extant data collection methods and transfers in all stages of disease/ pandemic management. Both SMS and CDR information are equally important. They provide a rapid baseline and situational knowledge, especially in scarce data environments, and can significantly increase efficiencies, consistency, and ease of data capture and transfer for the institutions involved in data management. This calls for the need for further research on specific social, cultural, technological, and epidemic contexts to promote the integration of mobile data sources into humanitarian response efforts while at the same time ensuring that the data collection approaches do not compromise the ethical standards.
 
 To sum up, the article's review confirms that mobile technologies can help reinforce disaster management. Bengtsson, Lu, Thorson, Garfield, and Von Schreeb (2011); Cinnamon, Jones, and  Adger (2016) show how cellphone data can track and manage humanitarian crises caused by natural hazards. While the authors used different approaches, the outcome was the same. Further, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, disease surveillance and management using mobile data information would have gone a long way in reducing the impacts of the virus on the lives of the million people that the disease impacted either directly or through loved ones and family members. Nevertheless, it is evident from the review that mobile technologies have significant positive impacts on managing disasters and disease outbreaks.
