# My central research question

Does Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) pose as a major challenge in many public health sectors in adulthood? Exposing children to abuse, neglect and family dysfunctions not only does it affect the healthy emotional, physical and behavioral development but also contributes to morbidity in adulthood. The Biological Embedding of Childhood Adversity Model (BECAM) provides a clear explanation for this phenomenon. BECAM posits that childhood stress that arise from poverty or maltreatment causes cytokine response to challenge as well as reduce sensitivity in hormonal signals hence leading to problematic behaviors like living unhealthy lifestyles. These factors, when joined with other traumatic exposures are deemed to provoke chronic diseases in adulthood. Childhood adversity has been linked to health-related complications like obesity, liver diseases, cancer, skeletal fractures and heart diseases (Burke et al., 2011). The effect of ACEs in the development and controlling of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus has rarely been considered in many researches. The central research question is to identify the correlation between child traumatic events and chronic conditions later in life. 


# Type of inquiry


For the investigation relationship between adverse childhood and future chronic conditions would be done effectively through descriptive inquiry. Descriptive inquiry involves assessment of the profile of the situation and describe how it works and why is it does that way. The inquiry assesses the relationship of the occurrence of the chronic conditions among those suffering from adverse childhood experiences. The inquiry suits the central research question. Since it provides with the assessment of the situation and how it occurs, the descriptive inquiry helps in providing information necessary to understand the relation. Through such inquiry, a lot of gaps can be identified in the research, thus assisting in assessing the nature of the relation between adverse childhood experiences and the chronic conditions. Through the inquiry, the impact of the adverse childhood experiences in children can be assessed. The three subheadings include:


i.	What is the Impact of ACEs on Urban Pediatric Population?


ii.	What Can We Do to Prevent Childhood Trauma as a Public Health Issue?


iii.	Which Areas in the United States have ACE Cases?

Adverse Childhood Experiences like abuse, community and family violence, and neglect pose as significant health challenge in the United States. It is evident that 30-40% of youths who are exposed to family violence have a tendency of developing posttraumatic experiences like nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and physiological hyperarousal like insomnia. These symptoms affect behavioral, emotional and academic development of a child. The physiological impacts associated with ACEs not only does it affect the mental health of the child but has been seen to correlate with other medical conditions.To study the impact of traumatic experiences on the development of a child, a study between the prevalence of ACE categories in various urban populations was carried out. 


In this research, childhood trauma does not start with the child; it starts with the parents as well as grandparents of that child. A bottom-up approach is one of the geospacial methods is used upon the research to collect children's data by using ACEs scores. Another method is algorithm that helps in finding the relationship between the occurrences. This research would help in reducing effects of adverse childhood experiences, those who are affected also need to be helped. When appropriate ways to help those already affected are in place, the chances of developing these complications could be minimized.
