## de Hoop, J., Premand, P., Rosati, F., & Vakis, R. (2018). Women’s economic capacity and children’s human capital accumulation. Journal of Population Economics, 31(2), 453-481.

The article by de Hoop, Premand, Rosati, and Vakis (2018) focuses on a productivity transfer program run by FUMDEC that attempt to alleviate poor women's economic capacity and their spillover effects on the children's school participation. The authors use a simple model to illustrate the possible pathways through which such programs impact the children's activities. The program was reviewed under the model intended to achieve two goals. First, the program is intended to enable income generation and expansion by stimulating women's economic activities. Secondly,  the program endeavored to encourage women empowerment by improving women's ambitions in household economic decisions and social participation. The article goes further to illustrate that the program focused on offering educational services on community organization and awarness, vocational training on entreprenueships and technical skills that will enhance the small and medium size entreprises, animal hubandry, crop cultivaion, capital transfers and follow up services. Besides, the study's findings confirm that the school attendance of children from households that benefited from the program was more likely to continue even a year after the intervention, a phenomenon attributed to women's involvement in household decisions.
  The authors in the article focus on addressing poverty and inequality.  The article's ideas marry into the notion of development as propounded by Sen (2001) human development is about expanding the citizen's capabilities. de Hoop, Premand, Rosati, and Vakis (2018) evaluate a program that attempts to alleviate women's economic capabilities in Nicaragua, focusing on how such programs have spillover effects on the children's human capital accumulation. Moreover, the article demonstrates the argument  advanced by Sen, stating, "Development consists of removing various types of unfreedoms that leave people with little choice and little opportunity to exercise their reasoned agency." Hence, through the provision of economic opportunities to remove barriers to such opportunities, women will improve themselves and impact their children. The author adds that all citizens' inclusive participation is the only guarantee to individuals' freedom since the individuals play the role of active agents of change instead of passive recipients of allotted benefits. Further, scholars agree on the need for social systems to provide opportunities to improve the population's well-being. 


## Reggio, I. (2011). The influence of the mother's power on her child's labor in Mexico. Journal of development economics, 96(1), 95-105.

  The article focuses on the concern of child labor that has become rather prevalent especially in the low income nations. The article reports that close 352 million of children between the ages of 5 to 17 engage in some sort of economic activity. While child labor could be effective in the survival and development of children, it has significant adverse impacts on human capital accumulation.  The author further investigate the influence of Mother's bargaining power on her children's labor in Mexico. Based on the collective household model for child labor, the author reports that an increase in the mother’s bargaining power is linked to fewer working hours for daughters but not sons. The article's assertions indicate that target mothers' policies as welfare benefits can affect children's work with varying impacts for boys and girls. These assertions confirm that the household's bargaining power distribution is an essential factor that should be considered when looking into household decisions. Nonetheless, the article's findings reflect on the concepts of development as advanced by Sen (2001) on human development by expanding individuals' capabilities. According to Reggio (2011), the greater mothers' bargaining power, the shorter the amount of time on child labor, which improves the children's human capital.

  On the contrary, when mothers have limited bargaining power, their children, especially the boys, can be subjected to extended working hours that adversely impact their accumulation of human capital. Besides, the article focuses on the impact of women's economic capacity on the outcomes of children. Based on the collective model approach and census datasets on Mexico, the findings confirm that the greater the economic capacity of women, the better their children's capital accumulation. 


## Geddes, R., Lueck, D., & Tennyson, S. (2012). Human capital accumulation and the expansion of women’s economic rights. The Journal of Law and Economics, 55(4), 839-867.
  The article focuses on the impact of enacting laws that touch on women's property rights and women’s control of separate properties and market earnings. The economic approach advocates for married women to gain economic rights and develop an incentive to invest, ultimately resulting in girls' human capital. Furthermore, the authors went further to evaluate the impact of the legal changes on girls' attendance rates relative to that of boys. The researchers computed the effects of the law on school attendance among children aged 15-19 who are beyond the compulsory schooling age based on the census data. The investigation results confirmed that expanding women's economic rights has resulted in higher school attendance rates by girls between 15-19 years of age.  These assertions echo Sen (2001) ideas that creating equal opportunities as caused by the enactment of property rights improves women's human capital accumulation.
  The article's arguments add to the emerging body of literature on the impact on property rights on institutional change. According to Geddes, Lueck, and Tennyson (2012), having legal institutions that protect women's property rights and strengthen their investment has a spillover effect on other groups. These assertions bolster Sen (2001) argument, who described the primary factors that limit people's development as poor economic opportunities and systematic social deprivation. Looking at the issue under reive from Sen's perspective, the women's economic right expansion resulted in more significant human capital accumulation for the women and the children. Besides, these laws even that women, just like other citizens, enjoy equality in the workplace by getting remuneration on the same scale as their counterparts working the same job. Furthermore, from the perspective of Sustainable development goals, the article mirrors the goal of equality and women empowerment. The expansion of the women's economic rights would imply that women would be represented in various levels and occupations while at the same time enabling them to hold various employment opportunities.


## Ogawa, M., Koguchi, E., & Shibata, M. (2020). Support and Legal Systems for Mother and Child Victims of Domestic Violence in Japan and Singapore. Journal of Asian Women's Studies, 26, 1-13.

  The article explores the support and legal systems for mothers and children victims of domestic violence in Singapore and Japan. The authors highlight that in japan, support and protection of the victims of domestic violence are provided by public institutions following the implementation of the act on prevention of spousal violence and the protection of victims (DV Act). The authors further acknowledge that limited research on these services rendered to the mother and the children and the kind of support offered generally. The article's assertions confirm that the local government and other stakeholders in the private sector have been responsible for working with the victims to eradicate violence and offer support in Japan. Nevertheless, the article's findings confirm that these stakeholders are constrained by the Japanese legal system that has failed to include gender violence support in various policies. This has made it challenging to provide meaningful support to the victim of domestic violence in Japan. Further, Ogawa, Koguchi, and Shibata (2020) compare women's protection in japan to that of Singapore. The scholars argue that Singapore's domestic violence policies involve a network of care that extends beyond individual position and works jointly to end domestic violence as per the women's charter and the Vulnerable Adults Act. The paper adds that unlike in Japan, where the services targeted women as the primary victims of family violence in Singapore, there is no hierarchy as each of the individuals is considered a victim. Furthermore, the women's shelters are supported by the government and are integral in offering front line support for the victims. Besides, the citizens' role in the quest to ensure the safety and well-being of victims of family violence cannot be overlooked, considering they have a responsibility to report family violence suspicions. The policies are designed in a manner that promotes inclusions in the services offered, such as counseling of the victims, and the children's needs and interests are also taken into consideration to reduce the anxiety that the children are experiencing.
While Sen (2001) does not directly discuss domestic violence in the various discussions of a family, at least three assertions are relevant in thinking about how domestic violence could impact human development and well-being. These include capabilities and functionings, agency goals, and instrumental freedom, which are affected adversely by domestic violence.  Based on the capabilities and functionings, sen believes the capabilities reflect on an individual's capacity to achieve their potential. Nevertheless, as illustrated by Ogawa, Koguchi, and Shibata (2020), domestic violence is a threat to realizing this human potential as it undermines the capabilities and functionality of a woman in different ways. For example, the severe physical and emotional injuries caused by domestic abuse can undermine women's economic freedoms like her ability to go to work, seek an education that upgrades her skills, acquire property, and assert her property rights. Besides, family violence has the potential to erode women's social opportunities by undermining their abilities to foster and nurture the social relationship and social capital. For instance, typically, relatives and friends tend to avoid households prone to violence. The woman's self-worth is eroded, forcing her to be withdrawn from the other society members. These assertions are consistent with Sen (2001) postulation of the significance of self-respect and participation in the community as an essential element of functioning.
Lastly, consistent with Sen (2001) assertions and the benchmark of Singapore, as illustrated by Ogawa, Koguchi, & Shibata (2020), the focus must be directed to policies laws for effective development in society that protect all the victims of family and spousal violence. This is not only going to ensure the wellbeing of women, but it is also going to promote the participation of women in various areas in the society, allowing women to engage in meaning full economic activities while at the same time promoting the women's economic freedoms and rights. Besides, the concept highlighted reflects on various sustainable development goals, including goal three of well-being and health, gender equality, and reduced inequalities.


## Agarwal, B., & Panda, P. (2007). Toward freedom from domestic violence: The neglected obvious. Journal of human development, 8(3), 359-388.

  The article "Towards freedom from domestic violence: The neglected obvious," the author discusses the concept of freedom as propounded by Amartya Sen.  According to Agarwal and Panda (2007), domestic violence is a serious unfreedom that affects various areas of human development as it affects the well being and capabilities as well as social opportunities. The article's primary argument is that domestic violence of whatever form adversely affects the physical and psychological well-being of an individual and undermines women's capabilities to function and lead a life that she deserves. The impact of such violence extends to future generations, especially when a child witness acts of violence directed towards a parent. The authors go further to add family violence not only impacts the immediate well being of women and children but also their long-term well being through the inhibition of their political, economic, and social freedoms (Agarwal & Panda, 2007). Collectively, the scale of such violence can impact the developmental trajectory, considering it promotes inequalities. Further, the authors recommend the need to reduce marital violence by developing effective policies while reinforcing the already existing measure against family violence and the promotion of women's property rights and economic freedoms. The article under review echoes the assertions by Sen (2001) on human development.  Moreover, it can be argued that the authors built on the conceptions of freedom as advanced by Sen. While Sen's conception of unfreedoms did not mention domestic violence directly, he simplicity argued about the adverse impacts of the phenomenon, pointing that it affects women in various aspect of life. For instance, the author's argument on domestic violence echoes the assertion of Sen on instrumental freedoms. According to Sen (2001), there must be protective security, economic facilities, social opportunities, political freedoms, and transparency for any effective development. These instruments are effective for the development of humans and the promotion of the development of a nation. Hence, domestic violence prevalence violates the guarantees of protective security, which makes women and children vulnerable to hunger, unemployment, and ultimately causing the population to gravitate towards poverty and misery. Domestic violence also undermines the notion of home as a secure space.
Basing on the articles, family violence is also seen to undermine the wellbeing and agency goals. An Individual's well-being in this perspective is considered important in developing the person and realizing their full potential. Being a victim of domestic violence adversely affects the well being of an individual both physically and emotionally. Emotional and physical abuse affects the individual's ability to interact physically or partake income-generating activities. Besides, people tend to avoid domestic violence victims. The victims themselves can avoid people due to shame and embarrassment as she begins to believe that she deserves the ill-treatment she received from her spouse or partner. Like Sen, the authors assert that freedom from family violence should be integrated into all discussions about freedom, well-being, and development. The arguments of the article reflect the need for gender equality in sustainable development goals. The arguments also mirror the concept of inequality. When women enjoy freedom from domestic violence, they can develop various skills and knowledge that can help them in ensuring that they realize their maximum potential in society. Thus it is important that states and governments formulate and implement policies that protect women and children from domestic violence and other forms of spousal confrontations that can adverly impact their lives and inhib their ability to develop and reach their maximum potential. 


## Personal insights

  The inclusion and empowerment of women in various economic and social activities cannot be overlooked. As demonstrated by the annotated articles, women enjoying developmental freedoms have spillover effects, especially on their children. For instance, whenever a mother has higher bargaining power, her children are less likely to spend more time in child labor (Reggio, 2011). Similarly, women enjoying the property and economic rights directly impact the enrollment and attendance of the girls in school (Geddes, Lueck, & Tennyson, 2012). Besides, programs that empower women and provide them with skills to help them fend and provide for their families in Nicaragua confirm that children from households that benefited from such programs are more likely to remain in school even after the program's conclusion. As demonstrated above, the greater the opportunities and freedoms enjoyed by women, the more the development witnessed.
