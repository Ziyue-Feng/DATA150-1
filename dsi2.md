# Prediction of Suicidal Thoughts and Mental Illness by Machine Learning


Machine learning refer to the use of artificial intelligence that offer systems with the capability to learn and enhance from experience without regular programming. The technology of machine learning focus on the improvement of computer programs, which could access data and use the data to learn independently. Today, machine learning can evaluate social media data in a promising way to obtain environmental influences that lead to personal risk for suicidal behaviors and thoughts (Allen et al., 2019). Machine learning is an important method being used to forecast suicidal thoughts and deal with mental health illness in the society. The adoption of machine learning is useful in predicting the risks for suicidal thoughts among people by evaluating the available social media data such as twitter data. Suicide and mental health illness remains major health concerns despite the growth in diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. The progress in suicide screening innovations via accessing and reviewing social media data is important and useful in identifying the risks for the mental health disorders. 

The implementation of the machine learning (ML) technologies such as smartphone, wearable, and smart home technologies provide longitudinal data that offer possibility of identifying new predictors via data driven model of machine learning. A research by Allen et al. (2019) determined that machine learning techniques helped to improve the prevention of suicide rates.  For example, the machine learning evaluations of military administrative information and medical records identified around 50% of the post-army suicide deaths. In another study, machine learning was useful in the analyses of the functional imaging neural signatures of life-related aspects among suicide controls to identify the efforts for accurate classification. 
 
The development of a composite risk score for the patient via machine learning depend on computational process built by patterns of analyzing the data sets. The risk score and the clinical prediction guidelines are useful in establishing the score for clinical interpretation before the assigning of the appropriate scores.  Mental health care professionals understand the substance use disorders increases the suicidal risks for patients suffering with depressive disorder. The advantage of machine learning process is allowing the proper validation and improvement of the clinical prediction guidelines as the inputs increase. Machine learning also promotes accurate admission of patients and developing reliable suicidal risk assessment in complex clinical situations (Allen et al., 2019). Like all forms of technology, machine learning is effective in promoting proper assessment of risks and improving the optimization of the risk prediction process. Both the clinical and biomarker variables are vital in performing suicide risk forecasting to develop a composite score to help patients in the emergency departments and conducting comprehensive diagnoses. Future research efforts in psychiatry will seek to integrate machine learning technology to improve the effectiveness of the suicide prevention programs.
 
To sum up, machine learning is an effective technology that would help in predicting for suicidal thoughts among mental health patients. Suicide prevention is a complex program that reduce technological input to identify risks to deal with the patients effectively.  Machine learning would allow for the creation of composite risk score that guideline clinical schedules of identify suicide risks in mental health patients. Some of the benefits of machine learning technology is offering reliable risk assessment, and assist health care professionals to admit patients into the triage effectively. Therefore, psychiatric facilities should rely on machine learning to improve the forecast on suicidal thoughts and mental health problems.
