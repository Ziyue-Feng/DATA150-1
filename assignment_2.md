## Introduction


 Disasters and pandemics have been in existence since time immemorial. The impacts of such hazardous events have been far-reaching and sometimes change the trajectory of human life. The phenomenon has recently been felt with the emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic that has currently put the world on a standstill. Fortunately, the emergence of new technologies has been critical in the response and mitigation of these disasters. There is currently a growing body of research on how mobile technologies have impacted and shaped the management of disasters in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic the impact of mobile technology has been felt during the COVID-19 epidemic, where the technology was used to trace the people who are believed to have been exposed to the disease. Besides, technology has been critical in the crisis period. It allowed individuals who show symptoms of the coronavirus diseases to contact healthcare practitioners who offered guidance on the management and care of individuals with the disease. In this respect, mobile phone technology in disaster aid and planning is critical, primarily through the analysis of the Mobile Network Operators (MNO) data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data that can rely on live mobility patterns of the users of the phone booth at the locally and across the country, enabling health practitioners to contact trace while at the same time offer medical advice.

 According to Sen (2001), development requires the removal of unfreedom in people's daily lives. Such unfreedom includes the lack of proper healthcare facilities. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare as human freedom has been put to the test and the modern healthcare facilities stretched to their limits. While such epidemics are unforeseen, the healthcare facilities and structures must remain robust to provide the citizens with the freedoms associated with healthcare services. Thus, it is essential to review various articles that address mobile devices' use in disaster aid.


## Critical analysis 


 According to BBC (2011), mobile phone data was crucial in disaster aid in Haiti. The article illustrates that mobile phone data was critical in the relief work as it allowed the aid workers to provide humanitarian help to the victims of the earthquake.  The report points out that in the aftermath of the earthquake majority of the residents fled the city of Port au Prince, making it difficult to help those who had been adversely affected by the natural hazard. Fortunately, through the utilization of mobile network organizations, data scientists and relief aid providers were able to contact trace all the parties affected by the earthquake and provided them with much-needed care.
By the adoption of the mobile phoneâ€™s technology, the relief aid workers in Haiti managed to ensure the safety of the citizens through the use of innovative technologies to help in targeting those who need relief aid it could be medical aid or resources for sustenance like food, shelter, and clothes that could have been destroyed by the earthquake. Using the technology to limit the unfreedoms associated with the quake and improve citizens' situation by promoting safety and well-being.

 The news article's assertion is further bolstered by empirical research by Gething and Tatem (2011).  The scholars argue that disaster management requires accurate data and must link the data collection and analysis to an immediate decision-making process. The authors acknowledge that the current approaches to evaluating the population movement immediately after a disaster are inadequate through critical among the individuals living in the remote areas of the disaster sites. The scholars further add that the proxy analysis, such as satellite reconnaissance, has potentially been impactful in the process; however, it has only provided a coarse topographical image of moving populations. There is the risk that such reports sometimes constitute a biased representation of events. 

 Besides, these assertions are consistent with the research by  Bengtsson, Lu, Thorson, Garfield, and Von Schreeb (2011) that focused on Haiti's earthquake relief response. In the study, the researchers propose using position information of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile service providers in Haiti Digicel to determine the magnitude and trend of population movement following Haiti's 2010 cholera and earthquake. Furthermore, the study's findings confirmed that routine collection of information on the movement of all active SIM cards in the disaster-affected nation could, with potentially high validity, be used to provide estimates of the magnitude, distribution, and trends in the population displacement. Through comparing census information before the disaster, the approach could be used to estimate area-specific population sizes that could result in an essential improvement in the allocation of relief supplies and the quality of needs assessment surveys. The study also indicates that the method was appropriate for close to living monitoring of population movement during an infectious disease outbreak.

 Additionally, the utilization of mobile technology in humanitarian aid is not only limited to natural hazards. Salathe et al. (2012) propound the notion of digital epidemiology, which involves mobile, social, and real-time communication to map the disease patterns among individuals. The researcher's perspective is that when harnessed and analyzed correctly, the digital data sources can provide local and timely information about a disease and the population's health dynamics globally. The authors also touch on the emergence of big data and its relevance to the epidemiology of infections. Additionally, the scholars suggest that the development and utilization of mobile technology information have helped improved disease surveillance compared to the traditional approaches that depended on theories and field practices that were inadequate, particularly during stressful conditions. The authors add that the population's movement can be tracked using mobile data and technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).

 Besides, the article propounds that the use of call information, messages, and other mobile technologies enable individuals to be easily tracked as the analysis of this kind of information can pinpoint the locations of the individuals and also determine the pattern of movement among the citizens of interest allowing for an easy and timely determination of the whereabouts of the individuals and the people they made contact with throughout their interactions (Salathe et al., 2012). Nevertheless, this practice is riddled with numerous shortcomings. First, such practices raise the question of privacy and confidentiality. While citizens are aware that the telephone service providers could collect certain personal information, the use and dissemination of such data have often been contentious. It often touches on critical personal data and sometimes an infringement of one's privacy.

 The other issues are technical concerns, particularly regarding collecting, evaluating, and distributing the information collected from individuals' phones and other digital devices (Salathe et al., 2012).  The compilation, storage, and analysis of the massive data sets require sophisticated algorithms and software to be expensive to acquire and manage. The infrastructural requirement for collecting Realtime time data must include high bandwidth, low latency computer networks, access to vast amounts of storage, and additional machines for computation. These technical requirements and the large volumes of information make such systems impervious to hardware, network, and software failure.

 A further challenge is designing the algorithms and data structures that are efficient and scalable for the mining, processing, and analyzing large-scale epidemiological data. Besides, making sense of such information. Besides, making sense of data and minimizing errors require cutting-edge technology and cutting-edge medical analytical skills.  These challenges make it difficult for the effective and timely implementation of such models and systems during disasters and pandemics.  Nonetheless, such a surveillance system would have been critical with the current COVID-19 epidemic as healthcare institutions could quickly contact trace and use mobile information to determine how many people have been in contact with victims, making it easy to contain infection rates reduce mortalities.

 Besides, another essential innovative technology that has proven to be useful in humanitarian aid is social media. Lu and Brelsford (2014) collected three distinct datasets from Twitter, immediately before and after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan. The investigation revealed that while the entire population was affected and the online activities increased. The Japanese speakers who were presumed to be at the center of the disaster expanded their network to a higher degree than English speakers or the global average. This confirms the systematic framework for investigating human behaviors under extreme events with online social network data, providing essential insights for understanding social interaction patterns during an extreme event.

 The researchers aver that the study's data shines a light into individuals' behavior during stressful conditions. The researchers report that an in-depth analysis of social media data can help track the behavior patterns of the victims of natural disasters and hazards. Using the data, the aid workers can quickly determine the individuals affected by the hazard and its extent. Besides, considering the big user data generated by social sites. The interactions within the communities in the social sites can help aid initiatives to target specific individuals and help contain the impacts and the effects of the Tsunami on the general population.

 The research on the use of innovative technology in disaster aid is further bolstered by Cinnamon, Jones and Adger, (2016) in an African study that focused on health threats like Ebola and the Zika virus.  Through the review of various relevant literature and conducting in-depth interviews with the Key informants to confirm the assumptions that the data that has been collected and mined from CDRs and SMS can be utilized in the management of the pandemics. The authors also report that mobile phone data contain essential information that can steer disaster management. They provide quality and a substantial amount of information relating to diseases and disasters.

 However, in many nations, the rolling out of such surveillance programs have been curtailed by various ethical concerns (Cinnamon, Jones, & Adger, 2016). The primary concern in such scenarios has often been individuals' data privacy. The article posits that data privacy has been studied significantly and was also a concern raised by the interview participants. The confidentiality issue was mainly directed to utilizing CDR data, considering it is full of personalized data about locations, Spatio-temporal movement, and an individual's communication patterns. Besides, the author acknowledges that it is possible to identify sensitive personal information from the data sets. The SMS information also raises serious privacy and confidentiality concerns as they are often designed to collect significantly sensitive data. Moreover, for the SMS systems designed to collect data from people on resources required or disease, an individual's locational privacy can be compromised. The compromise can also be seen in systems designed to collect signs and symptom information from the public contributions that often require that the ethical principle of confidentiality be broken.

 Nevertheless, the scholarsâ€™ assertion confirms that data mining from a mobile phone could bolster the extant data collection methods and transfers in all stages of disease/ pandemic management. Both SMS and CDR information are equally important. They provide a rapid baseline and situational knowledge, especially in scarce data environments, and can significantly increase efficiencies, consistency, and ease of data capture and transfer for the institutions involved in data management (Cinnamon, Jones, & Adger, 2016). This calls for the need for further research on specific social, cultural, technological, and epidemic contexts to promote the integration of mobile data sources into humanitarian response efforts while at the same time ensuring that the data collection approaches do not compromise the ethical standards.

 Lastly, in the Flowminder (2020) resource for the management of COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers discuss utilizing anonymized mobile operator data to support the intervention against COVID-19 by improving our understanding of population movements.  According to the research, the anonymized and aggregated mobile data from Mobile Network Operators is critical for understanding the mobility patterns of the population and can be used in improving decision making and scenario planning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Data from MNOS can be analyzed in near real-time and provide an overview of mobility patterns both at local and international levels, enabling the healthcare practitioners to contact trace the individuals who have been in contact with the infected.

 The process proposed in the resource involves collecting raw data from the MNOs; the information is then aggregated to allow the study of the pattern of movements of the people. The data is then converted into actionable insights that can be used in decision making.  The data can be utilized to trace the contacts of those in the vicinity suspected of being exposed to the virus while giving the medical officers an easier task to trace them and place such individuals in quarantine facilities. Such efforts shall go along way to eliminate unfreedoms that deter citizens from access to equitable humanitarian and healthcare services and promoting development through proper and effective healthcare practices.  


## Conclusion


 The analysis of the articles confirms that mobile technologies can help reinforce disaster management. Bengtsson, Lu, Thorson, Garfield, and Von Schreeb (2011); Cinnamon, Jones, and  Adger (2016) show how cellphone data can track and manage humanitarian crises caused by natural hazards. While the authors used different approaches, the outcome was the same. Further, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, disease surveillance and management using mobile data information would have gone a long way in reducing the impacts of the virus on the lives of the million people that the disease impacted either directly or through loved ones and family members. Nevertheless, it is evident from the review that mobile technologies have significant positive impacts on managing disasters and disease outbreaks.
