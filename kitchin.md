The article examines how the availability of big data and the use of new data analytics challenges the established epistemologies in science, social sciences, and humanities. At the same time, it assesses the extent to which they are engendering multidisciplinary paradigm shifts. The central focus of the article is the exploration of new forms of empiricism and the declaration of the "end of theory" the adoption of data-driven rather than knowledge-based science as well as the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that advance radically diverse approaches to making sense of culture, history, economy, and society. The data-driven science implores to hold to the tenets of scientific methods while at the same time ensuring openness in the utilization of a hybrid combination of adductive, inductive, and deductive approaches to promote the understanding of a phenomenon. The article's primary assertions include acknowledging big data and new data analytics as a disruptive innovation that is reconfiguring the approaches to research praxes that have resulted in the proclamation of the emergence of a new fourth paradigm that is founded in data-intensive exploration challenging the established scientific deductive approach.
  
  Furthermore, the article argues that there is an urgency for more comprehensive critical reflection in academia on the impacts of the unfolding data revolution's epistemologies. The author adds that the development of the big data and new data analytics creates an opportunity for reframing the epistemology of science, social science, and humanities while at the same time modifying the development of changes that are already occurring across disciplines considering big data and new data analytics have enabled new approaches to the generation and analyses to be implemented and make it possible to frame questions in different ways considering that unlike in the past where there was limited data set to the scope and analyze data, the emergence big data allows so much data that the main concern reported by researchers is the big and dynamic and varied datasets a phenomenon that has resulted to the development of new forms of data management and analytical techniques that are dependent on machine learning and new modes of visualization. Moreover, the article confirms the need for a broader reflection on big data and data analytics' epistemological implications, which is yet to start.
